    "To balance out the class imbalance in the previous classification model, we applied unsupervised machine learning models, such as Principal Component Analysis and KMeans, to figure out common purchasing behaviors among existing customers. Using the new features from PCA, we clustered labeled observations into 15 groups. \n",
    "As a result, we found the following: \n",
    "- know more about the customers better (rather than overfitting) \n",
    "- predict more precisely regarding business questions\n",
    "- findings some potential business costs that need to bear\n",

    "With a class of wholesaler and personal for the label, it predicted mostly wholesalers for the new observations. This is due to wholesalers account for the majority of the labeled observations. \n",
    "Flora should market promotion to \"Medium Customer\" and \"Premium Customer\". As a result of PCA clustering, we found that there are 3 clusters. This means that the behavior of these clients is divided into three groups. And it is speculated that these two groups are not individual consumers but wholesalers and retailers. Therefore, we suggest that Flora conduct a marketing campaign targeting this group."

    "Flora is a real online retailer selling mainly decoration household items. When this firm opened, they thought it would only serve individual users, but gradually a new segment of small wholesalers arose. Flora needs to know which customers are wholesalers in order to market to their needs. Therefore, based on the historical data of sales from December 2010 to December 2011, we built an algorithm to classify whether the customer data is a wholesaler or personal. By using the logistic regression method, the algorithm was 85% accurate.\n",
    "Furthermore, we conclude our analysis by using Unsupervised Learning Models which eventually have reduced the data imbalance and made a better prediction. The flow is as follows.\n",

    "<br> The main problem with our first Logistic regression model is that the observations of the dependent variable are unbalanced (82%/18%), which automatically makes the confusion matrix and the logistic regression model easy to predict with more than 80 % accuracy.\n",
    "In addition, when analyzing the result of our prediction model, it is possible to observe that most of our testing samples came back with true positives. However, since the second most frequent testing samples returned false negatives, we can not rely on this model entirely. False-negative in an outcome makes the model mispredict the negative class. In other words, the model was not accurate in predicting the 'Personal' observations due to the imbalance of data.\n",

    "Since there were 7 explanatory variables in the dataset, the features were converted to principal components by using PCA. As a result, the contribution rates were 37.5% for PC0, 28.9% for PC1, and 22.2% for PC2 (total about 88.6%). PC4 (contribution rate 10.1%) was not added because it exceeded the reference value of 80%, which generally explains the variance of the dataset.\n",
    "MAX Components Factor Loadings:\n",
    "Looking at MAX Components Factor Loadings, it is characterized by the smallest order quantity and each purchase quantity of b1. Therefore, the b1 group was named \"Small customer\". On the other hand, the characteristics of the b3 group are that the number of orders and the amount of each purchase are very large. We named it \"Medium customer\". We named it \"Premium customer\" because b2 has the characteristic that the number of orders and each purchase is average.\n",
    "Interpretations:\n",
    "First, the common point of b1 is that the number of purchases and the purchase amount are small, but it can be interpreted as a potential basis for individual consumers. This is because individual customers cannot buy large quantities of goods like wholesalers do. Or it's possible that the retailer bought it once but didn't repeat it. Next, the b2 purchasing characteristics are so average that there isn't much difference between the positive and negative scales. It is possible that wholesalers and retailers regularly purchase certain products for this cluster. Alternatively, it can be a potential basis for individual customers to make regular bulk purchases. Finally, the b3 group has in common that they buy a lot at high frequency. It is strongly inferred that the reason for their behavior is that they are wholesalers and retailers. Therefore, it is possible that they regularly buy goods from Flora for their business. It is generally unlikely that an individual consumer will buy a product in the same way as a company."

    "To sum up, we have improved the model since there was an imbalance in the previous model that we had and knowing customers deeper by using unsupervised learning. Another thing is to change the threshold to improve the imbalance it. Our recommendations are to have more classes to have more groups as there were too many wholesalers. Moreover, to apply the algorithm with other variables such as demographics, psychometrics rather than only for purchase behavior. As a result, it can understand the entire picture to optimize the cost as well as improve the potential revenue. "
